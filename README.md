## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. **Initialize a Git repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Create a new repository on GitHub.**

3. **Link the local repository to the GitHub repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Settings" tab.
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".
   - Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch" and choose the `main` branch (or whichever branch you are using) and the `/root` directory.
   - Click "Save".

Your portfolio will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/` in a few minutes.

**Note:** This project uses `particles.js` from a CDN, so an internet connection is required for the animated background to work.
