            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a recent BSc IT graduate with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for technology. My academic journey has provided me with a solid understanding of software development, database management, and networking.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional experience in technical support has honed my problem-solving skills and allowed me to interact directly with users to resolve their issues. This role has taught me the importance of clear communication and a user-centric approach to technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now eager to transition into a full-stack development role where I can apply my skills in a more creative and impactful way. I am particularly interested in building scalable web applications and contributing to all stages of the development lifecycle. I am a quick learner, a collaborative team player, and I am excited to embark on this new chapter of my career.
